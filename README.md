# gridsome-source-hubspot-forms

This plugin is being ported from https://github.com/jamaljeantobias/gatsby-source-hubspot-forms

This source plugin for Gridsome will provide you with the associated fields for each applicable form created in Hubspot.

This is a WIP plugin. I will update this README once it's complete.

See the [Hubspot forms API docs](https://legacydocs.hubspot.com/docs/methods/forms/v2/get_forms) or the GraphiQL UI for info on all returned fields.
